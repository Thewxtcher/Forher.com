            <h1>This Is Why I’m Building.</h1>
            <p>Kiaya, Morning Dove,</p>
            <p>I know the landscape of my life right now isn’t what I envision for us. There are late nights fueled by coffee and raw ambition, often on an empty stomach. There are days where every decision is a calculation of scarce resources. I remember giving you what little I had, not out of grand gesture, but because even in scarcity, my instinct is to provide for you. And I have no shame in this moment, because this isn't my destination; it's just the current build.</p>
            <p>I am not broke. I am in development.</p>
            <p>Version 1.0 of me struggled. Version 2.0 is disciplined. I am debugging my life, meticulously refactoring the parts that don’t serve our future. Every line of code, every system I design, every late-night session where the screen is the only source of light &mdash; it’s an investment. An investment in the infrastructure of our shared tomorrow.</p>
            <p>You are not my distraction. You are my direction. You are the compelling ‘why’ behind every commit, every refactor, every difficult decision to choose growth over comfort. The idea of a stable home, of quiet mornings, of a future free from financial anxiety &mdash; it’s all architected around you. It’s what drives me to write the next version of myself, a version capable of building the world you deserve.</p>
            <p>Morning Dove, you are the reason I compile instead of collapse. You’re the constant in a variable world, the elegant solution to every complex problem. Loving you means refusing to stagnate. It means becoming more, not just for myself, but for us. This isn't just about 'making it'; it's about building a foundation so strong, so secure, that our future stands on bedrock.</p>
            <p class="signature">I am building because I love you.<br>And loving you means becoming more.</p>
